### Hansard Analysis

#### What's this?

This repo contains code to analyse the Hansard archives, which are available online (http://www.hansard-archive.parliament.uk/) in beautifully marked up XML.

So far, the code feeds in archives from a particular year (the 1909 archive is given here as an example) and returns the 500 most frequently spoken phrases of length 'n' words.

#### What's next?

Figuring out how to visualise the results clearly, possibly showing the changes in most frequently used phrases over time.

Training a RNN to auto-generate plausible sounding members' contributions.

Comparing the 'airtime' given to male vs female backbenchers and figuring out whether this is in proportion to their numbers.

Assessing which backbenchers are disproportionately talkative/the worst filibusterers.

Using sentiment analysis to assess how the tone of Parliamentary discourse has changed over time.
