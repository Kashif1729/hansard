### Hansard Analysis

#### What's this?

This repo contains code to analyse the Hansard archives, which are available online (http://www.hansard-archive.parliament.uk/) in beautifully marked up XML.

So far, the code feeds in archives from a particular year (the 1909 archive is given here as an example) and returns the 500 most frequently spoken phrases of length 'n' words.
